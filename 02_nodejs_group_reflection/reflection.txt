    As one of the lead developers, my main contribution was in the project's implementation stage, wherein we were to build a front-end-focused system. 
However, the team and I decided to utilize Back-End-as-a-Service to handle the back-end side. I focused on the logic behind our system, while my 
co-lead developer focused on the front-end side. The decision also made it more challenging than it should've been, and we should've focused solely 
on what we were asked and required. We also experienced unexpected adjustments with the task allocation due to losing two members.

    When assigning tasks and collaborating, I would say that our team delivered a decent outcome. However, we could have presented a better system if 
we had been more open to sharing all ideas from every member. If a member does not fully share their thoughts on solving a problem or improving the 
system, I consider it a missed opportunity to produce quality work. All members should not be afraid of criticizing the work of the other and all 
members should be able to take one. Too much nitpicking and overthinking were also problems for our team. 

    As a developer, I want to improve in every way. I want to enhance my knowledge and skills in both front-end and back-end. As our capstone project 
approaches closer, There's no better time to develop full-stack development skills since most teams only rely on one developer. As I also mentioned 
in the previous assignment, I want to be more efficient in understanding code syntax to catch up with the same pace of discussion.
